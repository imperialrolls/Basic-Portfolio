				<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/IMG_0226.JPG" alt="photo_of_me">
				<p>Greetings and salutations. Back in 1997 after landing in San Francisco I secured a position as an internet researcher for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB9500455234318488">Scudder Kemper Investments</a>, which was devastatingly boring, however I was given access to a Bloomberg terminal and a <a href="http://disinfo.com/"> corner office </a>, which provided ample time to seek out my next position at <a href="http://listen.com/">Listen.com</a>. Ah the early days of the digital music landscape. What a wild time until of course Napster fucked us all. I stayed with Listen.com until an acquisition by MTV/REAL Networks, which provided a compensation package large enough to focus on my <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/11039-KimoSciotic-Records">vinyl record label</a> and time to hold out for my next gig</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>From 2005 until 2009 I was Senior Editor, Project Manager, and eventually interim Product Manger for MP3.com, which after being purchased at a yard sale price from Vivendi was dusted off, semi-revived, and eventually drove into the ground by CNET.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>CNET dissvoled my site in 2009 and after a brief walkabout I became manager of the famed San Francisco book store and cooperative art gallery Adobe Books. This lasted until news of my mother's failing health forced my departure from San Francisco back to the desert where I am now reinventing myself via a full stack front-end web development program.</p>
